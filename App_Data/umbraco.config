        <contentBody><![CDATA[<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>To offer truth and hope to high risk, mentally ill, disadvantaged and often homeless adolescents, and their families.</p>
<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>The year 1970 was a time of change and chaos resulting from the decade of the 1960’s. Substantial numbers of adolescents were living on the streets, many of them coming from turbulent family situations, trouble with the law, or departure from other institutional settings, including jail. These troubled youth had no place to go except to the streets, so a concerned group of private citizens approached a medical group with a plan to organize a shelter for these youth. Third Way Center founder, Dr. Hildegard Messenbaugh, a noted Denver psychiatrist, agreed to not only open the shelter but to also provide the necessary mental health treatment for adolescents, and Third Way Center began.</p>
<p>This third way of living became the alternative to homelessness and incarceration for troubled youth and offered a path to healing and wholeness through mental health treatment, quality education, and intensive life skills training in a home-like, safe environment. Today Third Way Center has grown from one shelter to a large continuum of programs and services offering residential treatment, intensive mental health diagnostics and assessments, state approved educational programs and a robust independent living skills training.<br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /></p>]]></contentBody>

<p>Prior to joining Third Way Center as full-time medical director, Hildegard served as the Medical Director at Mt. Airy and Lutheran West Pines Psychiatric Centers, and developed a thriving private practice in Denver.  She has held positions with the Colorado Advisory Council on Mental Health and was previously a commissioner on the Governor’s Special Task Force on the welfare of Children.  In 2003, Hildegard received the Exemplary Service Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Colorado Child and Adolescent Mental Health Coalition. She was recognized on National Public Radio as a winner of the “E-chievement” award on E-Town Radio and was featured in Colorado View magazine as one of Denver’s most influential women.</p>
<p>Hildegard has recently completed a training manual on the unique treatment methodology she had her staff have developed over the past four decades resulting in a 70% success rate for Third Way Center teens.</p>]]></profileBody>

        <contentBody><![CDATA[<p><img src="/media/1030/whatwedo_snapshot.jpg?width=846px&amp;height=476px" alt="undefined" rel="1283" /></p>
<p>Child abuse in the United States has reached epidemic proportions. Each year it’s reported that more than 6 million children are abused annually. While this fact is shocking, it doesn’t reveal the tragic reality of physical, emotional, mental, and sexual abuse that children face every day. Statistics often hide 6 million stories and each of these stories reveal how trauma impacts the lives of these young people, as well as how it leads to a variety of mental health issues and difficulties functioning within society.</p>
<p>Although, the battle against child abuse is daunting, Third Way Center continues its mission transforming the lives of teens impacted by traumatic events. Prior to entering Third Way Center, 93% of teens experienced some form of abuse. Although these horrific events disrupt their lives and ability to succeed, our experienced mental health professionals are here to provide a pathway towards healing through Third Way Center’s Six Boxes© treatment methodology. This unique process, as well as our educational, independent living skills, and vocational programs offer teens the Truth, Hope, Justice, Courage, and Mental Health they need for a better tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Overview of Programs</h2>
<p>Third Way Center provides teens impacted by trauma with Truth in the form of accurate mental health assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. We provide Hope through individual, family and group therapy, education, vocational training and placement, life skills training, parenting skills training and more. Our five Residential Child Care Facilities (RCCF), Next Steps Program, and the Jefferson County Emancipation House provide opportunity to help 111 youth and up to 12 babies at any given time.</p>
<p><img src="/media/1031/whatwedo_snapshot2.jpg?width=846&amp;height=292" alt="undefined" rel="1284" /></p>
<h2>Third Way Center’s Six Boxes Treatment Methodology</h2>
<p>Third Way Center follows an innovative trauma-based mental health therapy developed by Founder and Medical Director, Hildegard Messenbaugh. Through the Six Boxes© Treatment Methodology youth not only learn the connection between their behavior, feelings, and abuse they have experienced, but are also supported throughout their journey towards the restorative <a name="_GoBack"></a>justice needed to establish new feelings and behaviors.</p>

        <title><![CDATA[Admissions Process]]></title>
        <contentBody><![CDATA[<p>If you have a client who may be a possible placement at Third Way Center, please contact Dave Eisner, Executive Director at 303.780.9191 x460 (office) or 303.898.7861 (cell).</p>
<p>To assist in determining whether a client is a good fit for our programs, we will generally require information on the client including: Reason for referral; current situation; court reports; results of any previous psychological testing; discharge summaries from previous placements; and education information. This information will be reviewed and if the client is appropriate for the program an admissions assessment will be scheduled with one of our intake professionals. Following the admissions assessment, a decision will be made regarding whether the youth will be accepted into our programs.</p>
<p>Typically youth in Third Way Center programs are referred by Department of Human Services, Division of Youth Corrections, various mental health centers or, in some cases, private placement. Private parties who are interested in our programs should contact Dave Eisner for further information<br /><br /></p>]]></contentBody>

        <contentBody><![CDATA[<p>Third Way Center’s Specialized Programs are additional ways that we provide support and opportunity to youth throughout our organization.</p>
<h3>Drug and Alcohol Treatment</h3>
<p>Some youth struggle with drug and alcohol addiction. We have a full-time Master’s Level Drug and Alcohol Treatment Coordinator working with these youth on an ongoing basis.</p>
<h3>Vocational-Education Training</h3>
<p>The Voc-Ed team performs job skill assessments, teaches resume writing and interview skill development for youth. This program helps them retain employment or seeks volunteer opportunities to help build new skills. </p>
<h3>Independent Living Skills Training</h3>
<p>Due to unstable family situations or growing up in in highly institutionalized environments many youth entering Third Way Center do not have the skills necessary to live on their own. With the help of therapists and mental health counselors, youth learn to prepare grocery lists, properly store food, cook, clean do laundry and perform all tasks necessary to live independently.</p>]]></contentBody>

        <title><![CDATA[Help a Youth Emancipate]]></title>
        <contentBody><![CDATA[<h2>Furniture &amp; Household Donations</h2>
<p>Often, when our youth emancipate into their own apartments, they own very little — mostly just their clothing and a few personal items. We help ease the transition by providing youth with donated household items and furniture. Please remember that our youth are typically moving into small studios or one bedroom apartments.</p>
<p>You can also help Third Way Center by donating to The ARC Thrift Store!  You can contact the ARC for a pick up and inform them you are donating on behalf of Third Way Center. To schedule a pickup of your donated goods, please call 303 238-JANE (5263) or 800 283-2721 and Jane will be happy to help, or if you prefer, you can <a href="http://www.arcthrift.com/donation/schedule-donation-2.html" target="_blank" title="ARC Thrift Stores Online Pickup">schedule an online pickup here</a>. As a result of this donation Third Way Center will receive vouchers that our youth can use when they need items.</p>]]></contentBody>

        <contentBody><![CDATA[<p>Third Way Center is thankful for all the amazing volunteers that have come through our doors over the years! From landscaping and painting, to raising awareness in the community and creating online crowdfunding events, volunteers are essential to the success of our youth!</p>
<p>If you, your friends, or coworkers are interested in getting involved at Third Way Center <a href="mailto:crobisch@thirdwaycenter.org" target="_blank">email Chris Robisch</a> to find out how you can help organize a volunteer group project and give back to our youth!</p>
<h3>Mentors</h3>
<p>Many of the youth at Third Way Center are in need of positive adult role models. Mentors develop lasting relationships with our youth, providing guidance and offering them stability in times of crisis. It’s common for Third Way Center Mentors to  become close friends with our youth, as they are known to attend high school graduations, Thanksgiving, and other celebrations.</p>

        <blogPostContent><![CDATA[<p>Aaron came to Third Way Center in the summer of 1986. His 13-year old biological mother had lost custody of him, and he was placed with a foster parent struggling with alcohol addiction. Making matters worse, Aaron lived in a neighborhood overran by gang violence, and he spent most of his time between ages 12-17 living on the streets or in group homes. Third Way Center was Aaron’s saving grace – offering him the truth &amp; hope necessary to overcome the trauma of his past.</p>
<p>At Third Way Center Aaron was provided accurate mental health diagnosis from experienced professionals. Through Third Way Center’s Six Boxes© treatment methodology, Aaron not only learned the connection between his behavior, feelings, and trauma, but was supported throughout his journey towards the restorative justice he needed to establish new feelings and behaviors.</p>
<p>Aaron excelled at Third Way Center and was given an opportunity to further his education. He eventually earned a scholarship at a University in Pennsylvania where he ran track and field, breaking school records. He had many successes while in college, but he still remembers his first day, being dropped off at school by Third Way Center Executive Director, Dave Eisner. Dave flew from Denver to Pennsylvania with Aaron, helped him register for classes, made sure he was settled in, had money in his pocket and that he was alright before Dave headed back to Denver. To this day Aaron considers Dave Eisner, Renee Johnson, and other staff members as parents.</p>
<p>Aaron worked hard to become the person he is today! He graduated, Magna Cum Laude, in the top 10% of his class. He currently works for the government as a Senior Grants Officer, and even finds time to coach an inner-city basketball team. Aaron has been married for over 20 years, and has three children with his wife, Amy. He loves his family very much, and provides them with a lesson in hope whenever he talks about the experiences he overcame to get to this point.</p>

        <blogPostContent><![CDATA[<p>Adrienne Greene wears many hats. One of her favorites is as a board member of Third Way Center in Denver.</p>
<p>Third Way Center serves traumatized teens who have endured unspeakable abuse and neglect. Before they arrive, they have been in an average of eight and up to 30 other placements.</p>
<p>Because they are low income and many have no families to which they can return, they are at risk of homelessness or incarceration. Third Way offers a “third” option – successful residential treatment that empowers them to become successful, productive members of the community.</p>
<p>In celebration of Third Way Center and her commitment to these young people who have so little, Adrienne competed in the Florida Ironman Triathlon on November 1st. Through the crowdfunding site, Indiegogo, Adrienne connected with friends, colleagues, and family members to help raise $2,710!</p>
<p>We’d like to thank everyone who donated to this event, and we’d especially like to thank Adrienne for training daily for the Ironman Triathlon--you rock!</p>]]></blogPostContent>

        <title><![CDATA[Jean: Law Student, Wife, & Mother of Three]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h3>Jean’s Journey:</h3>
<p>As a 14 year old runaway Jean was in and out of group and foster homes. By 16 she was “defiant and on drugs” and living on a friend’s couch. It was at this time she was placed at Third Way Center (TWC), where she stayed for almost 2 years.</p>
<p>Her stay at TWC was not always easy, but she made it through. After leaving our program, she moved to Seattle where she lived in her own apartment. She thanks TWC for teaching her the independent living skills necessary to survive. Jean feels that her experiences at our Lincoln Street Supervised Apartments, in particular, taught her how to “be an adult.” Additionally, she thanks TWC for helping her to become part of the community and for giving her “tough love” and the basic limits that she needed at the time. She says that many of the behavior management techniques that she uses with her own children are things that she learned from the Third Way staff.</p>
<p>These days Jean is 30 years old, a student at Denver University’s law school (hoping to focus her law career on criminal and juvenile law), a wife of seven years and a mother of three children. She is happy and successful. And while Jean has many life experiences that have led her to where she is today she remarks that her experience at Third Way Center was a good one and that our program isn’t about “just housing and feeding you, it was about wanting you to be successful and not giving up.” Jean has never given up on herself and as a reminder of her days at TWC, she has a simple household item – a pot, given to her during her days at Lincoln – that has traveled with her on her journey and is still in her kitchen today.</p>]]></bodyText>

        <title><![CDATA[Aaron: Senior Grants Officer]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h3>Aaron's Journey:</h3>
<p>Aaron came to Third Way Center in the summer of 1986. His 13-year old biological mother had lost custody of him, and he was placed with a foster parent struggling with alcohol addiction. Making matters worse, Aaron lived in a neighborhood overran by gang violence, and he spent most of his time between ages 12-17 living on the streets or in group homes. Third Way Center was Aaron’s saving grace – offering him the truth &amp; hope necessary to overcome the trauma of his past.</p>
<p>At Third Way Center Aaron was provided accurate mental health diagnosis from experienced professionals. Through Third Way Center’s Six Boxes© treatment methodology, Aaron not only learned the connection between his behavior, feelings, and trauma, but was supported throughout his journey towards the restorative justice he needed to establish new feelings and behaviors.</p>
<p>Aaron excelled at Third Way Center and was given an opportunity to further his education. He eventually earned a scholarship at a University in Pennsylvania where he ran track and field, breaking school records. He had many successes while in college, but he still remembers his first day, being dropped off at school by Third Way Center Executive Director, Dave Eisner. Dave flew from Denver to Pennsylvania with Aaron, helped him register for classes, made sure he was settled in, had money in his pocket and that he was alright before Dave headed back to Denver. To this day Aaron considers Dave Eisner, Renee Johnson, and other staff members as parents.</p>
<p>Aaron worked hard to become the person he is today! He graduated, Magna Cum Laude, in the top 10% of his class. He currently works for the government as a Senior Grants Officer, and even finds time to coach an inner-city basketball team. Aaron has been married for over 20 years, and has three children with his wife, Amy. He loves his family very much, and provides them with a lesson in hope whenever he talks about the experiences he overcame to get to this point.</p>

        <title><![CDATA[Robert: Supervisor & Fine Arts Student]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h3>Robert's Journey:</h3>
<p>When Robert moved to Pontiac he was struggling, and he “didn’t know how to feel about being there.” But, moving through our programs, he began to “grow up a little bit” and “become more responsible.” He had already completed his GED before entering our Third Way Center, so he focused on getting a job. He found employment at Banana Republic which he held for quite awhile. Toward the end of his stay at Third Way Center, Robert knew he wanted to go on to higher education, but he didn’t know what his options were. The staff at Third Way Center helped him navigate the confusing processes of college applications, securing financial aid, and applying to live in the dorms. He transitioned from his Next Steps apartment to the dorms on campus where his college education and the beginning of his career on campus began.</p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a> Robert enjoys his courses in the fine arts and is proud of working his way up to a supervisory role at his job. About a year ago Robert also took the time to volunteer on Third Way Center’s Lowry Campus, helping residents at Hope Place by doing a cooking group, playing basketball with them and giving them hope that, like him, they could make it in the “real world.” His reason for volunteering -- Third Way Center helped him and therefore he wanted to give back. Robert attributes Third Way Center to different successes in his life. He mentions that the independent living skills he learned here are the main reason he “keeps his own place clean now.” He, of course, appreciates all of the help he received navigating the higher education ropes, and his favorite thing about Third Way Center is simple but so important, having someone actually listen to him.</p>]]></bodyText>
        <successStorySummary><![CDATA[Meet Robert, he’s a twenty-one year old fine arts major at Metro State, who also works full-time at his on-campus job in the supervisory role of Parking Coordinator. Not long ago he was a resident at Third Way Center. As a teen, Robert was having legal and family issues and was living with several different family members. Finally, at the age of 17 he was placed at Third Way Center by the Department of Human Services. He moved into our Pontiac House initially, then to our Lincoln Street Apartments, and finally to our after-care program, Next Steps, where he discharged successfully.]]></successStorySummary>

        <title><![CDATA[Michele: Mother & Kitchen Supervisor for MCHD]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h3>Michele's Journey:</h3>
<p>Michele was one of 16 youth living at Third Way Center’s only program at the time, our York House. Dave Eisner, Third Way Center’s Executive Director remembers Michele as one of the first clients he ever served.</p>
<p>Michele was in her mid-teens when she came to Third Way and was, in her own words, “incorrigible.” She knew she was bright, but struggled in school, had a turbulent relationship with her parents, and began using drugs - all of which led her to become an 8th grade drop-out and eventually a run-away in the criminal system. Her parents didn’t know what to do with her and she didn’t know how to care for herself. She was angry and alone until she was placed at Third Way.</p>
<p>During her time at York House Michele began to grow into the adult she is today. She was placed in an alternative high school and earned her GED. She learned how to live and work with other people. She was also exposed to intensive mental health services and psycho-therapy for the first time ever, which gave her an opportunity to speak openly with her mother and begin mending bridges. Third Way struck a balance that worked for Michele – enough structure to help her learn to take care of herself, but enough freedom to help her discover and nurture her interests, like cooking, a skill she uses in her career today.</p>
<p>Now Michele has a great relationship with her mother, which she credits to the family therapy she received at Third Way. She is also a proud mother of a 29 year old daughter. Her career is important to her; she has been in her position at 2 Succeed for 5 years and is even headed back to school to obtain her Certificate in Nutrition and become a Master Nutritional Therapist. <br /> If she hadn’t been placed at Third Way, Michele is not sure that she would have stayed off the streets or out of jail. It took time, but she realizes now how important the foundations of learning she gained in her early adolescence are to her current success and recognizes that when kids are in trouble or in trauma, their ability to learn and grow cognitively can be significantly impaired. Third Way Center, she muses, “really fills in the gap with emotional education youth need to succeed.”</p>]]></bodyText>

But in the late 70’s, during her teenage years, Michele was a run away, living on the streets or at interim placements until she found herself in juvenile hall and eventually was placed with Third Way Center.]]></successStorySummary>

        <title><![CDATA[Sean: Business Administration Student]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h3>Sean's Journey:</h3>
<p>Sean came to Third Way Center in 2009 and has traveled through our continuum of care, living at our Lowry Campus, Pontiac House, Lincoln Street Supervised Apartments and now in a Third Way Center foster home. He learned many skills while living in our therapeutic residential facilities: hygiene; cooking; dishwashing; laundry; and most important, justice for his past abuse. But, he still lacked some important relationship skills, making foster care a great “last step” before emancipation. Located in Jefferson County, this 5 bedroom suburban house is home to 4 teenage boys who are all in the foster care system. Foster mom, Katie, lives there 24/7, 365 days a year and cares for the boys. They are a family.</p>
<p>Sean literally fits now. He proudly states that he has “the longest bed in the state of Colorado.” Sean is studying business administration at Community College of Denver (CCD) and he can finally complete his homework in comfort, thanks to a taller, custom-made desk and chair Katie purchased for him. Katie has helped Sean transition to a young man with a new, more grown-up wardrobe that fits his frame and a new, stylish haircut. But fitting physically was only half the battle. Growing up in institutional and ever-changing settings, Sean has a lot to learn about fitting into a family. Families tease one another, they play pranks. In a family you don’t have someone monitoring every single move you make, you can grab a snack without asking permission; you can have food fights or water fights and not be punished or charged with a crime. You do chores, dye Easter eggs, and play putt-putt. Sometimes you fight and sometimes you have fun. In a family your mother is not a staff member, she sees you every day and she gives you hugs. In a family you learn fundamental skills about love, trust, integrity and responsibility. At 20, Sean is learning.</p>
<p>Recently, Sean asked Katie if he can call her mom, his first in 15 years. He’s come to understand that the teasing from his 3 foster brothers is part of normal family life, and he even dishes it out once in awhile! Like most families, the boys will prank each other in fun, but will stand up for each other in an instant if someone else dares to pick on one of them. Katie is proud of Sean, he has “overcome a lot and is thriving.” Sean will always have the Third Way Center staff and community who care for him but now, thanks to our Foster Care division, he also has a family where he fits.</p>]]></bodyText>
        <successStorySummary><![CDATA[Sean has been waiting his whole life to fit. Being 6'9'' it's hard for Sean to fit into clothing, a bed; fit his knees under a desk. He was removed from his home at age 5 and has had to learn to fit in at a different home or treatment center nearly every year since. Now, at age 20, living in a Third Way Center foster home Sean is learning what most of us know by a very young age, how to exist in a family unit. He's found a woman he's chosen to call mom and peers he can interact with as brothers. He's found a family where he belongs.]]></successStorySummary>

        <title><![CDATA[Will: Computer Science Major]]></title>
        <bodyText><![CDATA[<h3>Will's Journey:</h3>
<p>At age 12, Will began treatment because of his difficulties with peers and family. By the age of 17, he had failed in 2 treatment programs and made only minimal progress in a lock-down facility. When he was ready to leave this jail-like setting, he came to Third Way Center to learn independent living skills while receiving mental health treatment.</p>
<p>In our programs he learned how to identify and deal with triggers that lead to inappropriate behavior. A bright young man, he honed his school skills, developed job skills and learned how to cook for 16 people at once!</p>
<p>He attributes his school success to the teachers at JFA, our alternative high school. Although he struggled with various treatment issues, he enjoyed school and appreciated the individualized instruction he received here. He is now a Computer Science major at the Community College of Denver with a GPA of 3.5, as well as an IT intern at a local outdoor retailer. He currently lives in Boulder and dreams of transferring to CU in the fall to major in Computer Programming and minor in Japanese, a language he is teaching to himself.</p>
<p>Now, Will interacts appropriately with his peers and colleagues, is in a long-term, committed relationship, has family members he can turn to, and likes to hike and bike in his spare time.</p>]]></bodyText>
        <successStorySummary><![CDATA[Will believes that much of his current success is due to the Third Way Center staff who didn’t give up on him, no matter what happened or how many times he “screwed up.” He believes that the skills he acquired at Third Way Center have truly enabled him to become a successful and productive member of society.]]></successStorySummary>

<h3>Client Re-Entry Form:</h3>
<p><strong><em>(Completed by person conducting the re-intake interview)</em></strong><br />This form will be completed on all re-entry clients who re-enter after their bed is closed, even if it is the following day. </p>
<h3>7 Day Evaluation:</h3>
<p><strong><em>(Completed by Therapist)</em></strong><br />This report will be completed within 7 days on all residents upon entry into the program and when they transfer to another TWC facility. Please note that Lowry is considered one facility.</p>
<p>This report will also be completed on all re-entry clients who have been gone from the program longer than 30 days. This will be considered a new episode of care. Decisions to consider a re-entry client as a continuous episode of care can be made by the Clinical Director or Executive Director when extenuating circumstances exist. In this case a new 7 Day Evaluation and CANS will not be required.</p>
<h3>14 Day Treatment Plan:</h3>

<h3>30 Day Evaluation:</h3>

<li>The 30 day Evaluation schedule for clients who transfer will be based on the Date of Transfer. Transfers between houses at Lowry continue to follow the original date of entry for the 30 day Evaluations.</li>
<li>Clients who have re-entered the program and are considered a new episode of care, with a new 7 day and 14 day evaluation, will have a monthly schedule based on the new date of entry. If the client re-enters the program prior to the 30 days (or for extenuating circumstances it is considered the same episode of care) the original date of entry will be used.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Discharge Summary Without CANS and Outcome Data:</h3>
<p><strong><em>(Completed by Therapist)</em></strong><br />This report will be completed for each client within 10 days of discharge when they transfer to another TWC facility. This is also used if the client has been in the program for 30 days or less.</p>

        <contentBody><![CDATA[<h2>Conference Call</h2>
<p>Call the first person, then with the call active press Conference then dial the 2nd number. This puts the main call on hold, if you reach the 2nd person press conference to connect them to the conference call, if you get voicemail or something then press the button on the side of the screen that corresponds to the main call to return to the conference call and you will be reconnected with the first caller. Repeat the process for any additional numbers you want to add. This works with TWC extensions and outside numbers.</p>
<p>Then at the end of the call if you want to hang up from one of the parties you press the drop button on the keypad to enter the drop call menu. You will see on the screen that you can scroll using the side arrows between the different parties. Get the party you want to disconnect on the screen and push the button alongside the screen next to the word drop. If you drop yourself the call will be ended for everyone.</p>
<h2>HOLD vs. PARK</h2>
<p>The big difference with this phone is that if you put a call on hold you can only pick up that call at the phone where you put it on hold. If you need to pick up a call at another phone then instead of hitting the hold button press one of the Park lines indicated on the screen. Then you can pick it up from another phone by pressing the corresponding Park button on that phone.</p>
<h2>Leave a Message straight to Voicemail</h2>
<p>If you want to leave a message in a voicemail box without calling the phone or one message for multiple people go into the voicemail system. Then press 1 to record (instead of 2 to get messages). You can leave one message for multiple extensions here if you want.<br /> <br /><a href="/media/1063/twc_voicemail_flow_chart.pdf" target="_blank" title="TWC_voicemail_flow_chart.pdf"> Click here to open the Voicemail Options Chart</a></p>]]></contentBody>

        <question><![CDATA[How do I get to Remote Desktop from work or home?]]></question>
        <answer><![CDATA[<h3>Where is it? How do I open Terminal Server?</h3>
<p>We are using Terminal Server to access the RiteTrack system for P-Notes. "Terminal Server" means that from one workstation you use the Remote Desktop Connection feature in Windows to login to another computer, the terminal server.</p>
<p>RiteTrack software is installed on this terminal server at JFA. The primary benefit of this is speed. In addition, you can access the terminal server from any computer with the Remote Desktop Connection feature. It is built into most versions of Windows. Since you use your login on the terminal server an added bonus is that you can access any of your documents that are saved on the server because the terminal server will map your network drives when you login. Multiple people can be logged into the terminal server simultaneously.</p>
<p>To do this just log in to the workstation and open Remote Desktop Connection. Go to Start, Programs, Accessories, Communications, then click on Remote Desktop Connection. Other means to access it are using a Remote Desktop Connection shortcut from the desktop of the computers at work.</p>
<p>Once you have the Remote Desktop Connection box open type in:<strong><span> 50.78.206.133 (or remote.thirdwaycenter.org)  </span></strong>if you are at home, or type <strong><span>remote</span></strong> if you are at work.</p>
<p><img src="/images/staff/image002.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="117" /></p>
<p>Then click on Connect and it will open up a window where you can log in to the Terminal Server. Click OK on the Third Way Center Network dialog box. Then you will be able to login to Windows. You will use your network login here. Then you will see the Terminal Server Desktop. Click on RiteTrack to open it. There is a shortcut for the training database where you can enter bogus notes to learn how it works or train co-workers if necessary. There is also a shortcut for the Live Database where actual client data is entered.</p>
<p>To log in to RiteTrack you will use the following login criteria:</p>
<p><strong>User Name:</strong> first initial then last name (all one word, all lower-case)</p>
<p><strong>Password:</strong> the first time use Junk1234 Then you will be asked to change it to whatever you want. Remember what you put in, that will be your permanent password.</p>
<p><img src="/images/staff/image004.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="230" /></p>

        <answer><![CDATA[<h3>How do I Login? What password do I use? </h3>
<p>The first time you login it will be to the Third Way network on the Terminal Server and it will say Windows Server 2003 at the top of the login screen. Here you will enter your Third Way login and password (the complicated one that you use to get on the computer). This password will require you to change it every 3 months.</p>
<p><img src="/images/staff/winserv2003web-1-1.png" alt="" width="415" height="117" /></p>
<p>Then once you are on the Terminal Server Desktop you will click to open RiteTrack and it should log you in automatically. The RiteTrack password will be used for signing notes and census events. This password will stay the same.</p>]]></answer>

        <answer><![CDATA[<h3>I can't find the client I am looking for. What do I do? </h3>
<p>Every employee profile has unique settings in the My Tree view of RiteTrack. This allows everyone to have shortcuts to the information you use most. Here are some tips on how to manage your My Tree view.</p>
<p>Mostly you will use the Persons node of your tree, highlighted in the screen capture below. You can expand this node by clicking on the plus sign next to it and then it will open up a list of all the people in your tree.</p>
<p>You can add a client to your tree by clicking on Search Clients/Contacts.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thirdwaycenter.org/_images/staff/image006.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="348" /></p>
<p>Type in the name (first or last) or part of the name. RiteTrack will look for matches in both the first name and last name and come up with a list of possible matches. Double click on the person you want to add to your tree (or click on the Select button).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thirdwaycenter.org/_images/staff/image008.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="285" /></p>
<p>The search screen will disappear and you will that the person has been added to the Persons list on the left. Click on the plus sign next to the name and this will expand all the sections of this person's file. If the person did not come up in the list you may have spelled that portion of the name differently or they may need to be added. Click here for directions on adding a person.</p>]]></answer>

<p>Yes, probably. You need the Remote Desktop Connection function on your home computer. More recent versions of Windows have this built in. If your version doesn't have it we can work with you on getting it installed so that you can do this from home.</p>
<p>Try this first.</p>
<p>To do this just log in to the workstation and open Remote Desktop Connection. Go to Start, Programs, Accessories, Communications, then click on Remote Desktop Connection.</p>
<p>Once you have the Remote Desktop Connection box open type in:<span><strong> 50.78.206.133</strong></span></p>
<p>Then click on Connect and it will open up a window where you can log in to the Terminal Server. Click OK on the Third Way Center Network dialog box. Then you will be able to login to Windows. You will use your <strong>network</strong> login here. Then you will see the Terminal Server Desktop. Click on RiteTrack to open it. There is also a shortcut for the training database where you can enter bogus notes to learn how it works or train co-workers if necessary.</p>
